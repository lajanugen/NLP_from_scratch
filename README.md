This is a partial torch implementation of the paper "NLP from scratch".  

The window network is implemented and support for POS tagging, NER and Chunking is provided.  

To run the code specify the following in main.lua and run it (**th main.lua**)  
* params.task = {POS/Chunking/NER}  
* params.objective = {wll/sll}
